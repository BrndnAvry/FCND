These videos show the results of my work to complete the Udacity Flying Car Nano Degree program. The quadrotor demonstrate the custom cascading controller and EKF working together to fly a square flight path.

The fixed wing video shows the results of converting the cascading controller to work with a fixed wing UAV to follow preset waypoints.
